                <p> In today's lesson we covered the basics of HTML. We talked about basic structure, how a project should be structured,
                    and some basic common tags. Most of the class was spent on Git/ GitHub since this seemed to be the topic most of the students 
                    struggled with. We spent a bit of time ensuring that everyone got their Git configured correctly, that SSH keys were registered, 
                    and that everyone got up and running with GitHub. We also learned how to start a new project in Git as well as how to create
                    a repository in GitHub.

                <p>
                    In today's lesson we covered the basics of CSS. We did a theory test regarding information from last class and 
                    from the videos. We spent most of the class on the classwork which was to restructure our Course Diary and add some
                    new features we have learned (such as tables, forms, and images).

                <p>
                    In today's class we looked at CSS Box Model and how that effects the layout of a webpage. We also discussed UX/UI and 
                    what we should keep in mind when designing webpages so that they are user friendly. We did a theory check and was assigned
                    today's classwork which was to create an online store in a team of 4-5 people. The store was to be created as a collaboration where 
                    each person was responsible for one part of the page and we all work on different branches. We were to assign one team leader who 
                    took special responsibility for the project and made sure that everyone was on track, created the initial project, and was 
                    responsible for the index page. I was assigned to be our team leader which was fun.

                <p>
                    In today's class we learned about different font families and how you can add google fonts to your webpages. We also learned about
                    icon fonts and how they can be applied from pages such as Font Awesome. We took a look at Figma and how it is used as a development
                    tool for designing webpages. The class assignment was to create a webpage from a design in Figma. We were to think through 
                    the structure of the page and then spend some time thinking about how we were to complete this page before we actually started 
                    replicating it in code.

                <p>
                    The first homework we were assigned was to create a course diary. 
                    This diary should include propper HTML structure, headings and paragraphs, a section on classwork and a section on homework, as 
                    well as propperly commited, pushed, and working repository with Git/ GitHub. This is the product of that homework.

                <p>
                    The homework for the second lesson was to make our Course Diary look nice by adding CSS. Certain requirements were
                    expected to be met regarding what to include in the styling. We were to have color, images, borders, shadows, etc. All basic
                    CSS we had learned up until that point was to be included. This was mainly a classwork that became a homework in 
                    order to finish it. The main homework for this class was to create a CV in web page form. This CV was to include all 
                    HTML and CSS we have learned so far.

                <p>
                    The homework for the third lesson was to continue working on the classwork. We were to create an online store that demonstrated
                    all the different styles and coding we have learned. We decided to create an online ticket selling page with five pages: an index
                    page, product page, about us page, events page, and contact us page. I was assigned to be the team leader so it fell on my 
                    responsibility to create the initial repository and share it with the rest of the team, make sure they got themselves set up, and 
                    make sure they felt comfortable with their task. We divided up the work so that everyone was responsible for their own page and created 
                    that on their own branch inside the repository. We chose a unified design and font so that our page would look cohesive and then it was 
                    up to each person to fill their page with content. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The homework was to finish up the class assignment. The web design in Figma consisted of 7 parts. The mandatory criteria was 
                    to complete the first three part of the design. For those who wanted to do some more could also do part 4-6 and for the 
                    truly dedicated, all seven parts could be completed.
