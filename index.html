        <h3>Lesson one: Introduction to HTML and Git/GitHub</h3>
        <h4>February 12, 2020</h4>
        <p> In today's lesson we covered the basics of HTML. We talked about basic structure, how a project should be structured,
            and some basic common tags. Most of the class was spent on Git/ GitHub since this seemed to be the topic most of the students 
            struggled with. We spent a bit of time ensuring that everyone got their Git configured correctly, that SSH keys were registered, 
            and that everyone got up and running with GitHub. We also learned how to start a new project in Git as well as how to create
            a repository in GitHub.
